#### disclaimer

These program is given in good faith. I have put my best efforts in having all of it free of mistakes, but the full responsability for its use lies on you.

You must be aware that an erroneous connection, or a software error, or many other causes, can make your speaker drivers suffer currents that can damage or even destroy them. Please, be cautious, double check all your hardware and software setup and use electrical protections for your drivers (resistors, or capacitors when suitable) in the testing phases of your project.

I assume that you know what you are doing, and I take no responsability for any effect the use of this software may have.

You have been warned.
